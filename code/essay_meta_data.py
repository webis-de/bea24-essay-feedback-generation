More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. 

Write a letter to your local newspaper in which you state your opinion on the effects computers have on people. Persuade the readers to agree with you.

See kids have very sensetive eyes just like teenagers, but teens are more grown than the little ones. That's how kid's get their eyes damages. Now teens, were more grown up but we could still get our eyes damaged. It's by using the computer, cause they only go on the computer for myspace and myspace has a lot of typt word's in myspace and that's how teen's get their eye's damaged.

Although some people believe that these changes are for the worse, I can tell you that computers are the future, and we need to embrace it. Computers have many benefits, such as improvement to hand eye, coordination, instant and endless information, and great ways to stay in touch with friends.\n It may surprise you to know that computers are a great way to improve your hand eye coordination. Typing is a valued skill in today's world, and spending time on the computer is the only way to hone it. Schools even have classes these days that are designed solely for typing skills. Don't believe the typing improves and eye coordination? Try writing an essay without looking down at your hands, then reassess your hand eye coordination skills.\n One of my favorite things about the computer is instant information that you're always only a few clicks away from anything you want to know. Want to find the year of George Washington's death? Or perhaps you'd like to know where the longest bridge is located? Any simple question can be answered through the Internet dot the best part is: You don't have to get in your car, drive to the library and then spend hours pouring through books. You can simply lock onto the search engine or database and type in your question. Plus, the Internet can teach you how to do anything Easter is around the corner, and my mom looked up, how to fold the napkin to look like a bunny! As you can see, with the Internet at your fingertips, information is endless.Possibly the best aspect of the computer is how it allows you to keep in touch with your friends who have moved for a way. Although you may never see them in person, you can always use a WebCam should talk them face-to-face through the life chat. Also, you can send them emails which are quicker than letters.unlike phone calls which can be expensive, emails don'tCome up any bills. In addition, you will never have to leave another message again, because you can check your emails at your own leisure.\n You must agree with me: The pros of the computer outweight the con by a ton. Today's modern technology allows you to instantly improve hand, eye, coordination, get information, and connect with friends.technology is advancing, and it is for the better.",

They aren't spending enough time with their family or exercising. Also, while they're under their computers, forest are being cut down. Advances and computers will just make matters worse for society.\n People aren't spending enough time with their families, and computers are the main reason. It is known that people who spend time with family are more successful. In fact, recent studies show that family time increases grade levels by 15%, and reduces crime rates by 38%.However, people who spend too much time alone on the computer are more likely to have worse grades, and/or become a criminal. Computers are Taking away too much family time.\n People who spend a lot of time on the computer aren't realizing the harm that's being done to nature that connecting with nature makes people more caring, but forest are being destroyed. This mass destruction of nature causes many risks. It can affect the air quality, it destroys animal habitats, and it ruins chances for new products and medicines. The destruction of nature must be stopped, and sitting at a computer is just making it worse.\n People aren't exercising enough, but rather look at the computer all day.exercise is key to stay healthy. People who really exercise have a 27% increased chance of getting obese, having hard problems, and getting cancer. On the other hand, people who Exercise 2-4 times a week are proven to live up to 19 years longer than those who don't.People have to stop surfing the web and start running on a treadmill.\n It is proven that advances are simply going to make the lives of people, trees, and animals worse. People are spending time with family, saving nature, or exercising. These things aren't getting done and computers aren't helping at all Internet is used, it should be used for making trips for the family, or finding ways to save nature andn exercise. ",

For example, you can use it to look something up fast. For example, my cousin Bob wasn't sure about the local movie time so he went on the Internet and found it in a matter of minutes. But he's not the only one who has found the Internet useful for a quick find.In fact, it was surveyed that 7 out of 10 people use the Internet daily for a quick find that Dr. Peter Griffin says 'Without the Internet, we would be lost'. Do you want people to have a bad effect from not benefiting from using computers? I believe that another good effect from using computers is being able to get in touch with people. Just last week I was in need for help on homework. My friend has a email address so I emailed him my question and then he helped me out. But I'm not the only one who has benefited from being able to get in touch with someone when IWas in need. In fact 90% of computer users today are able to check with friends and get help that Dr. James Tyree says 'Without the use of computers, half of the world would not talk'. Do you want effect from being outside too much?\n Computers benefit our society by being able to educate anyone. Last month there was a special about a man who never went to college. Then there was a online college program that he could do from home. He got his diploma. But he isn't the only one who has been educated on the computer. In fact, 10 out of 20 people have gotten their college diploma over the Internet.School teacher doctor Wellenberger says 'half our world would not be educated if it wasn't for computers'. Do you want our world filled with uneducated people? Some may say Computers can cause obsession, or may cause people to get obese.

Maybe not, but it has happened to me and a lot of other people plenty of times that four out of five of my school have had a friend move far away.

And then you realize your notes are too messy and foregn loking to even read? If you have a computer, then you can just type them up. Two out of three of my friends have messy handwriting so they type on the computer instead. This is so much easier than using a typewriter too. You can backspace and print more than one copy with a computer.Will all of you people who write slow just bring a laptop to class and type your notes that I write slow but I can type faster than I can talk. We've covered that the computers are useful, but they are also educational.\n From the 21st century memories of fun computer games when they were little, but when they didn't know what that their parents bought it because it was educational. The computer has a way that teaches kids by having fun that I know I would rather learn my ABC's by playing a computer game, rather than repeating them over and over in school.The computer is also educational because if I don't understand a question, then I type it in Google search and I get a very well thought out answer.

If you make friends on Yahoo, you can instant message them I do that on YouTube people make YouTube accounts and create streams.stream is where you can talk to other users and watch videos at the same time. It is fun. People say that nine out of 10 peopleTalk to or instant message people that that is 90% of people. That is a lot of people. I am one of those 90%.\n In conclusion, the computer benefits society. You can use it when you're bored, you together, information, and talk to other people. The computer is a machine I hope stays around for a long time.",

They are good things and bad things about technology th I thought it would be best to compare the pros and cons of technologyTo see if it's really more trouble that it's worse, or if it's one of the best things ever.\n First, the good things about technology include communication, knowledge, and entertainment dot before there were cars and phones, it would take a while for people in different places to communicate important use to each other. Now you can get in touch with friends and family by pressing send. Also,The Internet is a great way to learn things about places that, if not for technology, people may have never known existed. And there are lots of people who, like to listen to music, and which movies, and unless they could sing or act they would find it very hard to have Those are just a few of the good things about technology.\n The bad things about technology, to name a few, or how people are getting dependent on technology, or are Not getting enough exercise because they spent all day indoors on the couch watching TV or at the computer sending IMs. Also, many people die because of accidents or housefires occur because an electric socket was overloaded or a computer overheated so much it caught fire. These are just problems with basic technology. Not to mention that people will be forgetting managed by talking on the phone at the dinner table or ignoring someone while watching TV. It's really not the best sing for society.\n In conclusion, the pros and cons of technology, both have some pretty good points, but I believe that technology is good for the world, because people are going into space or research. Try and find curses for diseases. Technology has helped the world way more than hurt it.",

        "explanation": "In this developed response, the writer takes the position that computers have had a negative effect on society and addresses three ways that computer time is cutting into more important things (exercising; traveling and exploring; family and friends). These reasons are moderately well elaborated with mostly specific details (53% of America's population is overweight) and effective rhetorical questions. The response is fluent and exhibits strong organization. More development is needed for a '6'.",
        "essay": "Have you ever wondered how much time you spend on the computer each day? Have computers ever gotten in the way of the more important things in life? Mostly all people would agree that computers don't always have a benefit to them that even I completely agree that computers Have a very lacking effect on people. This is because the time spent on computers usually cats into time spending exercise, traveling and exploring the world, and especially with their beloved, family and friends.\n First off, many Americans always never get enough time to exercise daily. About 53% of America's population, any age, is overweight. This probably has come to a result, because of the recent advances in technology is such as computers. Would you rather spend your whole life being unfit, while you could be healthy and happy about yourself? I'm not sure about the rest of America, but I would much rather be healthy and fit. Computers and other new technology have made us pick them over, old-fashioned exercising!Healthy is to enjoy life as unhealthy is discouragement in your lifestyle that don't let computers get in the way of your goals and dreams!\n Another reason not to use computers, so often is so you can explore the wonderful planet of earth! There are so many better things you could be doing there are much more exciting than computers! For example, the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon is a gorgeous and breathtaking landmark.Instead of researching about this majestic, you can un a computer you can be visiting it. A great deal of people in America have never been I would state. There is so much more to explore these days! Says executive tour guide of the Great Wall of China, Ron Falks. Experts like Ron Know how much time on earth we all have to spend, which is extremely minimal, so he's trying to persuade everyone to travel and explore, before it's too late!\n Last, but definitely not least, if you're on the computer all year long, how will you ever spend extra time with your beloved family and dear friends? Last year, my best friend was supposed to have a family gathering with a relatives from Oregon, who she barely even sees once a year. She refused to go since her parents wouldn't let her on the Internet, the whole day. As simple as that, computers can tear apart families.more than 60% of people around the world to see one side of their family. What is the cause of this? Could it be highly advanced computers and laptops? Of course!\n In conclusion, computers are not beneficial for the people of America, because this time could be spent exercising, traveling the vast world, and spending time with family and friends. Don't let computers get in the way of your life act now!",

Censorship in the Libraries
"All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us." --Katherine Paterson, Author
Write a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your views on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading.

        "essay": 'What is freedom of speech? It is the ability to speak out your mind without fear of prosecution – but is that all it is? Is it limited to verbal opinion? Or does every kind of speech count? Do books, music, movies, magazine, newspaper articles, and cartoons come under “speech”? Or are they the targets of the arrow called censorship? Author Katherine Paterson said, “if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf…then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.” Opinions can be expressed in several different ways. Vocally expressing one’s views cannot be repressed for once the words are spoken, they cannot be taken back. Books can be retracted; music can be banned; movies can be halted – but how are they any different from verbal expression? Merely because they express points of view through art does not mean that they are not a form of “speech” on the author or musician or film maker’s part. They are his or her way of bringing personal ideas and opinions to the public in an engaging manner, providing entertainment and broadening horizons simultaneously. \nLibraries everywhere have banned countless works under the pretext of their “offensive” nature. J.D. Salinger’s literary masterpiece, The Catcher in the Rye, was the cause of numerous revolts across the nation – parents did not want their children reading it in school, educators were appalled by the gross and perverted aspects of the novel – but today, people describe it as a book that captured the mindset of the youth of America during the 40s perfectly and a story that is “truly American.” What if, 60 years ago, censorship had engulfed the tale of Holden Caulfield forever? What if his story had been burned and doomed to never see the light of the day again? Would America have lost a great novel because of how it “offended” some people? Yes, they would have.\n Censorship is not “bad.” Sometimes, it is necessary. For example, sorting movies according to what age someone can watch them without it being “inappropriate” is beneficial it helps you receive knowledge and the truth about the world when you are truly ready to comprehend it. But banning them because of certain aspects that may not be pleasant to some is not helping anyone. If you do not want your child to read a book you deem “inflammatory,” make it your personal rule to keep them away from it. Libraries can make a different section of those kind of works, require parental consent to gain acces to them, or put a warning on them, but not stifle the creative souls of the minds behind these works.\n Paterson is right. One person may have a problem with a certain book – he raises people against it – the bookis banned. Another woman may not like a song because of negative ideas – she rounds up other critics – the song is banned. A parent may find a certain movie inappropriate and offensive – he creates petitions banning it – the movie is banned. You will never find them in any library anywhere. The idea here is that everyone will have problems with something or the other, but if we start getting rid of those things we ultimately end up with nothing at all. Control, not censor.

        "essay": "I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves of libraries even if they are found offensive to certain people. Libraries are not only meant for books but all types of informative items there for everyone’s use. If certain people believe that items in libraries are offensive, then they should simply stay away from those items. Reasons that I believe this way are, people need books and magazines as well for research, many people enjoy coming to libraries to listen to music and read magazines if they are not available to them elsewhere, and finally not all people find all the books, music, movies, and magazines offensive.\n To remove offensive items from libraries would make it difficult for people to get information they need. If you were to go to a library for research on a band, and the library didn’t have any magazines that were about the band because certain people found those magazines offensive, you would have a horribly difficult time trying to get deacent information. Magazines, music, and books are in libraries not only for peoples entertainment but for certain information that people want. If you were to remove anything offensive, people would know less about the world around them and libraries would be less popular. So, in the end, it would be a ridiculous idea to remove offensive magazines, books, and music from libraries, because most of those there are for information about certain people or places.\n Many people that I know go to the library to browse through books, listen to music, and read magazines that they do not have access too apart from the library. Now if someone took away the things those people enjoyed, they would have to live without and simply get to watch everyone else outside of the library enjoy that music or book, while they only get to watch from the side. When people are browsing throughout a library and come across something they find offensive, they should simply put down that book or magazine, or turn the music off; no one is making them read or listen to it. With that said, because a few people think that a magazine page is rude, or lyrics to a song are inappropriate, they should not ruin the entertainment for the people who do enjoy listening to that music or reading those magazines.\n Finally, not every single person in the world finds the same things offensive. Certain people love big tattoos, while others think that they are grotesque and rude. Just because a few people don’t like tattoos that doesn’t mean they should be outlawed does it? While in a library, almost everyone could find something that they think should not be on those shelves, but the next person may love that book and think it’s one of the best they’ve ever read. Everyone has a different opinion about everything, and if there are a few people who dislike certain books, magazines, or a certain genre of music, there are most likely a few people who absolutely love that book, or magazine, and love that genre of music. So just because there are people with a negative opinion on certain items, does not mean they should remove them from the shelves of libraries.\n In the end, I believe that they should not remove offensive itmes from the shelves, because they could be there for certain research, or for certain peoples entertainment. Personally I would be upset if they removed the offensive books, magazines, and music from the libraries, because as a teenager that is the genre I am mostly attracted to. I am aware though that the senior citizens of the world, do not find the same things that teenagers like very appropriate, but that’s not a big enough reason to take those items away. So finally, you have to think of what good it would do to take all offensive items off the shelves of libraries, because people like what they like, and simply taking those items off the shelves would not change hardly anything except the popularity of libraries.",         "explanation": "The following list describes a writing sample (shown on the previous page) that earns a Score Point 5 using the ISTEP+ Writing Applications Rubric.

ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitby Joe Kurmaskie
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fi ne.
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.
I hung my head.
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time.
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE YOUR BEST BET!
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking.
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even though I didn’t own a rod or reel.
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from my head as I slumped against the wall beside him.
“Where you headed in such a hurry?”
“Yosemite,” I whispered.
“Know the best way to get there?”
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group I’d listened to in Lodi.
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.”
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased.
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion.
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered.
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket.
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel.
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs.
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  “Dok Malik,” she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, “jasmine.”
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it.
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her.
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully. “Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind.
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where did you get it?”
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question.
“How much?”
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins.
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .”
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said.
“Then what else—?”
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.”
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.
“What happened?” she asked, more gently.
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said.
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.”
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled.
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said.
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.”
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.”
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply.
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her.
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?”
“I’d love it,” Saeng said.
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac.
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

Narciso Rodriguezfrom Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives
My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon call home.
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times.
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life.
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.

For example, 'They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.' They came from cuba. This showed love for their kids and that they would do anything to make their lives better. Another reason why the mood is love is because of what Narciso Rodriguez showed. He said 'I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.' That tells you that he cares about his parents. The last reason the mood is love is because 'family' was the most important thing to them. Narciso Rodriguez says 'I learned the real definition of family.'

The Mooring Mastby Marcia Amidon Lüsted
When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world’s tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at Forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. At seventy-seven stories, it was the tallest building before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip it in height.
The architect building the Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He secretly constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, and then shocked the public and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building.
Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world’s tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. He would add a top or a hat to the building that would be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. John Tauranac describes the plan:
[The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers.
This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come.
The Age of Dirigibles
By the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike a balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, or enclosed compartment, under the balloon.
Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform.
The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. The navy even offered its dirigible, the Los Angeles, to be used in testing the mast. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean.
When asked about the mooring mast, Al Smith commented:
[It’s] on the level, all right. No kidding. We’re working on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.
Designing the Mast
The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building’s flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building’s frame. The stress of the dirigible’s load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building’s foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars’ worth of modifications had to be made to the building’s framework.
Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would be housed in the base of the shaft itself, which also housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located.
The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor. This observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers.
Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building’s skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again—this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast.
The Fate of the Mast
The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.
The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.
The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible’s shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. 
Two weeks later, another dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp. The papers were delivered in this fashion, but after this stunt the idea of using the mooring mast was shelved. In February 1931, Irving Clavan of the building’s architectural office said, “The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.”
By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes. The rooms in the Empire State Building that had been set aside for the ticketing and baggage of dirigible passengers were made over into the world’s highest soda fountain and tea garden for use by the sightseers who flocked to the observation decks. The highest open observation deck, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public.

Another obstacle the builders faced was that 'the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents' (Lusted; paragraph 14). This problem was one that was never truly fixed and is a main reason why a dirigible never successfully docked at the Empire State Building.

As stated n the passge, there was a 'las against airships flying too low over urban ares' that would make it 'illegal for an airship to ever tie up to the building' (Lusted; paragraph 14).

Believe me, I've had my fair share of those actions. Once, I was running on the track at my elementary school, and I tripped over my humongous feet. I slammed into the cement and slid about 2 feet. By the time a teacher got over to me, I was bleeding and blubbering my hat off. They fixed me up, pretty good, but it was hard since both my hand, both my knees, and both my elbows were bleeding.The secretary, called my mom and told her what happened. My mom lost her hat for a moment, but in the end, she was extremely patient when she had had to change my Band-Aids, give me benedryl, and all that good stuff.\n There been plenty of times my mom has been patient with me; like when I broke the VCR player a little while ago, that I really don't know how I did it, but I managed to get a VCR tape stuck in the player. Evidently, I somehow got the tape stuck in between something in the machine. It's really complicated, so I don't want to go into it. This time, both my mom and my dad had to be patient with me. My dad stopped being patient when he had to unplug the VCR player, take it apart, and pry the tape out. By the time, all this was over, my parents hat, forgiven me, and the VCR player is still working.\n I'm really glad my mom stayed patient with me through thick and thin.if she hadn't, I'd be a wreck right now. An orphan, crawling on the streets, begging for a scrage of food, okay, that's a slight exaggeration, fine, a big one, but I'm still glad my mom stayed patient with me. That's why I love her so much."

There was a band playing and at first we thought it was them, but, after a while we relized it wasnt, it was there opening act, Roony.\n We thought they were only going to play one or two songs. So we sat down and waited. It seemed like they were going to play forever. I was trying to be patient and not start wanning, but it was hard.\n Fanily they came on stage. The Jonas Brothers were rockin out! Then I realized, even though it took a long time for them to come it was woorth waiting, and the concert was great.\n I was patient and I know I will be again.

We ate three cheeseburgers in two minutes that we finally got home at 10 PM and fell asleep.\n We are also being patient with the Meap test right now. It takes me so long to do the MEAP test. But I'm quiet I lay my head down and rest. I've been patient a lot of times in my life, and I am gonna have to be sometimes, and I am fine with that. I say this, because without patience, I'd be really annoyed, having to wait quietly.\n So now I'm being really patient by waiting for a garne to come out so I can play it. But even really patient people need a break every now and then that my mom and dad want me to rent the game first. They don't want to get it right when it comes out. So I have to wait a little longer, but I can live with that. They say I'm a very patient person. I had to wait two years for my Xbox 360, so I think I can wait for this.\n Besides, I had to wait anyways, because I'm already playing a game. I got a few weeks ago. This one time, we wanted to go on a ride in Michigan Adventure. It was called the Mad Mouse. We had to wait two hours, but it was so worth it. My mom was very scared that then we had to stay in a hotel. But there was a very big line there, too. But the room was very nice. Occasionally, we went swimming or went in the hot tub with bubbles."

Winning the election would definitely be his 'place in the sun'.\n Some problems when running for student body president is the opposing competitors. You have to be strong when it comes to criticism and competition. Unfortunately, this was not one of Damon's expertise. Almost always last when it came to dirty politics. A girl named, Sarah said, two days before the big vote, 'Damon accomplish what he promised and he still wets the bed!' People still haven't let that down and being the sensitive guy that Damon is, he wanted to be taken out from the running. \n Another hard aspect would be the student body. There are several hundred people watching your every move and judging everything you say. During this whole process, some immature kids took a marker and wrote 'Loser' all over Damon's posters another blister along the way was during third period. Some kids, we believe that it was Sarah and her crew, went to his locker and taped up a sign, saying, 'Your going down.' That wasn't too much of a disappointment for him because no one saw it. It just goes to show that you cannot be liked by everyone, but that didn't stop him. The big day was here and we were both so pumped up. The president and vice president from the previous year tabulated the votes. We knew it was going to be close. They were going to make their announcement during seventh period. Finally, with 10 minutes left in seven. The former president came over the entercom. I was holding my breath as they said, 'There has been a tie.' That was definitely a little bump in the road.\n In the end, Damon won by 14 votes!!! We were also excited for him. I took him out for ice cream, and the movie, my treat. So I guess you can accomplish anything if you wanted bad enough. Becoming president was Damon spot in the sun, because all those blisters."

        "essay": "All people, no matter what age, one to be accepted in life. Sometimes, however, people think illogically, and make bad decisions that to be accepted is to have a place in the sun among your pierce, and some people will do whatever it takes to get there.When my friend Jordan tried to get his plate in the sun, he expected to get blisters, but he didn't expect to lose his life.\n Last river is a recreation spot out in the middle of nowhere that my friend Jordan and I were on a day trip with a group of other boys. Jordan was really trying to fit in. I couldn't really understand what his motivation was or why fitting in these boys was so importanI just wanted to have some fun with my friend, but I might as well have been on the moon. We were sitting at the picnic table when Martin, the oldest of the boys, spoke.\n 'How about we go to the top of the bridge?'\n I laughed, but Jordan jumped right up and said 'Sure, let's go.' I was quite astonished, seeing as Jordan hates to swim, and the only reason went there was to jump off into the water.\n I was screaming at them, saying this was a stupid idea, but Jordan would do anything to be part of the crowd. As we approach the white gagantvan cantilever bridge I started to shiver. The bridge must have been over 100 feet high. I was trembling as we walked out to the center of the bridge. It was illegal to do this so I was trying to get them to stop.\n 'Who is going first?' asked Martin. The other boys turned and looked at Jordan. 'Jordan, you go first.'\n 'I don't know, it looks pretty high' Was Jordan's response. I looked at him, pleading and shaking my hats, trying to get him to turn back! 'GO! GO! GO! GO!' chanted the other boys. 'Jordan, lets just go back!' I screamed. 'Shut up!' Jordan gave into their pressure and cautiously climbed over the rail. I tried to grab him to pull him down. I was just too weak. The other boys held me back. 'Here I go!' said Jordan.\n Then he jumped.\n We all gasped and ran over to the site to see. There was an infinite silence as we watched his body fall further and further. When we saw the splash, the boys started cheering. I guess Jordan got what he wanted. My eyes were glued to the water. 10 seconds, 30 seconds, five minutes, we were frozen in fear and unable to see Jordan. Martin ran for help as I sang that I knew I wouldn't see him again.\n It took an hour for the ambulance to get there, and his body was not recovered for another four. They said his neck was broken on impact. Why did he do it? Why didn't I stop him?\n To this day, I ask myself these questions. Why was being accepted so important to him? I asked myself these questions. Every time I visited his grave. JORDAN THOMAS MARCH 15, 1987 - JULY 30, 2002. John wasn't the only one left with blisters after he tried to get his plates into sun that John's parents and friends, and I got blisters too. If it takes all of this to have a place in the sun, I will take rain any day."

        "essay": "A place in the Sun\n 'If you want a place in the Sun, you will have to accept some blisters.'\n I am a varsity jumper for my high school track team and I am proud.However, accomplishing this turned out to be much harder than I anticipated that not only was it difficult because of the physical demands of the sport, but also from the stress and pressure put on by those around me.\n It is not just a rumor that seniors can be intimidating that even the sophomores and juniors acted superior, Glad to be over the freshman hurdle at last. What can make them really upset is when some silly fresh cats into their time under the spotlight.\n Positions for the varsity and junior varsity track teams are supposed to be choosing based entirely off of skill. The seniors, however, failed to see why they work for three long years just to have an amateur freshman take their spot.\n There are three varsity openings for each event, and I took one for high jump, forcing a senior down to the junior varsity level that needless to say, I was not by any means her favorite person. Consistently during our competitions, I'd hear her whispering and subdued from the sidelines. I knew what they were trying to do. She and her friends wanted me to mess up so someone more deserving would take my place.\n Determined not to give in, I continued to try my best and in turn, continued to win. Eventually, I learned to sort of wary respect from them but I won't forget the way they acted.\n What bothers me most is my curiosity. Would I have acted the same way? Would I have tried to ruin someone's chance at a place in the sun because of my jealousy? I'd like to say that I wouldn't, but I do not know for sure. If this situation is ever reverse, I will try my best not let my envy drive me to be so disheartening.\n From this experience, I learned that the quote 'If you want a place in the sun, you will have to accept some blisters', really is true. I have my chance to shine, and it wasn't easy. I hope that I can teach others about what it feels like to get blisters, so everyone's place in the sun can be enjoyable."

        "explanation": "Ideas and Content: 4 The writing is clear and focused, and the reader can easily understand the main idea. Support is present although it is limited. The writer tells just enough about missing Homecoming to save money to buy a truck to score a low 4. Explaining the reasons for having to pay for everything but food would have provided a more interesting and balanced paper.\n Organization: 4 Organization is clear and coherent, and order and structure are present. The sequencing is clear and paragraph breaks are correct. The beginning and ending are recognizable but not particularly inviting. Overall, the organization is almost skeletal which accounts for the low 4 score.\n Voice: 4 The writer seems committed to the topic, and there is a sense of “writing to be read.” In places, the writing is expressive and sincere (“Painful as this is, its worth it” and “I couldn’t be happier because of my new truck.”).\n Word Choice: 3 Language lacks precision and variety. The writer does not employ a variety of words, producing a sort of “generic” paper filled with familiar words and phrases. Slang is not effective (“sucked”). Words are accurate and work but rarely capture the reader’s interest.\n Sentence Fluency: 3 The writing tends to be mechanical rather than fluid. The writing is characterized by some variety in sentence structure but little variety in length. Sentences are functional but lack energy.\n Conventions: 3 The writing demonstrates limited control of standard writing conventions. End-of-sentence punctuation is usually correct, but internal punctuation contains frequent errors. Spelling errors distract the reader, and misspellings of common words occur, e.g., “somone,” “they’v,” and “anyways.” Most of the contractions are missing apostrophes. A significant need for editing exists.",
        "essay": "'If you want a place in the sun, you will have to expect some blisters'. This could mean so many things. It reminds me of a decision I had to make not to long ago. If I wanted a new truck, I had to sit out Homecoming.\n I just started working for my parents in the land scaping company they own. Ever since then, I have been stuck paying for everything myself. Except for the food that I eat. But anyways, all cloths, dances, parties and travel I have to pay for, painful as this is, its worth it.\n About a month before Homecoming. My mom told me something thet really sucked. If I wanted my truck, then I was going to have to pay for it, And of course I wanted it. Its a Diesel Ford F250 longbed.\n So I started cutling down on all of my little things a normally do. like going to the mall and going out to eat. I was worried thet someone else might buy the truck if I didnt hurry up. Thats when I decided to stay home from Homecoming. I wouldnt be able to affort it.\n This was avery hard dicision for me to make. but its only a few blisters. They'v all already healed. And I couldn't be happier because of my new truck."
